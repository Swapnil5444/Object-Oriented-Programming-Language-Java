> Array is a collection of homogenous items 
> stored in consecutive memory location
> arrays in java are objects, hence they are created on heap memory
> steps to create an array
 1. declare array type with its reference e.g. int[] numbers
 2. create an object and assign it to reference -- numbers = new int[3];
 3. assign values to array elements
 4. array index starts with 0
 5. If size of the array once declared it is fixed 


Enhanced for loop
> when we want to iterate over arrays, collection sequentially from beginning to end use enhanced for loop. This was added in JDK 1.5 (AKA JDK 5)
> syntax is as follows
for(data_type variable : array_name){}


final Keyword
> if used with a variable , value of that variable cannot be changed.
> in other words it used to declare a constant
> if a used with a method that method cannot be overridden
> if used with a class, that class cannot be inherited

Enums (Enumeration)
> When we want user to pick a value from given enumerated list, we use enums
> enums were added in JDK 1.5 (AKA JDK 5)
> example of enums should be gender
> Syntax to declare Enum is
enum Enum_name {
	constants separated by ,
}
> enum constants are by default static and constants.

------SETTER and GETTER
Setter Method
> this method is used to change value of a specific attribute or field
> setter should be public 
> return type should be void
> method name should start with 'set' followed name of the attribute where first letter should be in upper case
> method should accept an argument of same type as the attribute type

Getter Method
> this method is used to get a value of a specific attribute 
> getter method should be public
> should have return type matching to attribute type 
> method name should start with 'get' followed by name of the attribute where first letter should be in upper case
> method should not accept any argument
> method should return value of attribute

> it is a convention and best practice to write setter getter method for private field and private attribute of a class
> these setter getter are used typically by frameworks such as spring, hibernate, 


Convention for Class Members
class{
	//attributes
	//constructors
	//setter, getter
	//methods
}


Inheritance
> Inheritance is a major pillar of OOP paradigm
> using inheritance we implement is-a relationship
> in other words when we have is-a relationship we use inheritance to implement it 
> in java inheritance is implemented using 'extends' keyword 
> inheritance allows us to create new class by inheriting properties of existing class
> existing class is known as Base-class, super-class, parent-class and new class is known as the sub-class, derived-class, child-class
> benefits - code reusability, polymorphism
> base class contains common properties and methods
> When we create and object of sub-class constructors are executed from top to bottom in hierarchy (parent to child)
> 1st statement in child class constructor is called to super()
> by default call to super() is called to no argument constructor of super class. If no argument constructor in super class is not present, compilation error occurs.
> child inherits a properties from parent in addition to that child can declare its own specific property
> superclass has no idea about child specific properties
> inheritance allows us to create an hierarchy where top most super-class is the most generalized class and the bottom most sub-class is the most specialized class.

Method Overriding
> if we want to change implementation of base class method in child class we use method overriding 
> Rules for Method Overriding
 1. Method name must be same
 2. Method signature must be same
 3. Access specifier cannot be more restrictive 
> Cannot add new broader checked exceptions in throws clause
> Method overriding gives us dynamic polymorphism also known as runtime polymorphism
> In java by default selection of method for execution happens at runtime based on type of object created
> Every class in java is extending Object class if not explicitly extending any other class 
> which means every class in java is directly or indirectly sub-class of object 
> java does not support multiple inheritance using class extends

toString Method
> each class should override toString() method 
> it is used to return useful information 
> this method is present in object superclass
