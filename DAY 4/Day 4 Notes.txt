String Class
> this frequently used class 
> it is present in java.lang package
> String is immutable - once the object is created its contents cannot be changed. Any attempt to change the content will create new String object and existing object would remain unchanged 
> String object can be created with as well as without 'new' keyword. for e.g.
String s1 = new String("a");
String s2 = new String("a");
System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); //true - checks the contents
System.out.println(s1 == s2); //false - checks the address/reference

String s3 = "a";
String s4 = "a";
System.out.println(s3.equals(s4)); //true 
System.out.println(s3 == s4); //true 

> String objects with double quotes "" are stored on string constant pool. It is a special area reserved only for string object
> the reason why java chose to make String immutable because String objects are cache in String pool
> Never use String object if we know it's gonna be mutated frequently
> If the frequent changes or updations is the requirement then String is not the right choice 

StringBuffer
> It is a class
> it is present in java.lang package
> StringBuffer is mutable
> StingBuffer is thread-safe class, hence it is slow in performance

StringBuilder
> It is a class
> it is present in java.lang package
> StringBuilder is mutable
> StringBuilder is NOT thread-safe class, hence it is better in performance as compared to StringBuffer
> StringBuilder was added in JDK 5

Abstract Method
> Methods which are declared but not defined are abstract methods 
> Syntax - public abstract return_type method_name();
 1. Method ends with a semicolon without curly brace
 2. add abstract modifier is used with the method
> In java abstract method can be declared ONLY inside abstract class
> Reference of abstract class CAN be created - AbstractClass obj; [ALLOWED]
> Object of abstract class CANNOT be created - AbstractClass obj = new AbstractClass(); [NOT ALLOWED]
> Abstract class can contain instance variable, instance method, constructor, static method, static variables etc
> Abstract class constructors are executed when object of child is created.
> The most generic class in the hierarchy is marked as abstract class.
> If a class is extending abstract class it MUST override all the abstract methods of the abstract class otherwise the subclass MUST also has to be declared as abstract
> Class with which object can be created is known as Concrete class (Non abstract classes are concrete class)
> Class can be declared as abstract without having any abstract method
>

Reference Variable Casting
> There are following 2 types of 
 1. Upcasting -
    > tyring to assign sub-type reference to super-type.  
    > Upcasting is implicit and safe.
 2. Downcasting -
    > Tyring to assign reference of super-type to sub-type
    > Downcasting must be done explicitly
    > downcasting can be risky. 

Package 
> its a named collection of related classes, enums, interfaces
> package is a directory
> relation can be is-a , by purpose, has-a
> java is set to be package centric language, meaning EACH and EVERY classes is defined in package
> Naming Convention - 
 1. Each letter of the package should be in small case.
 2. package name should be in the reverse order of domain
> for project studentmanagementpp, if the domain name is ycpait.ord --> then package name should be org.ycpait.studentmanagementpp
> this package name is mapped to physical directory structure
Steps to create a package
 1. 1st line in java code must be 'package' name of the package;

> a class which needs to used outside the package MUST be imported.
> By default every java file has 1 import statement available and that is 'import java.lang.*'
USES
> Package is used to organize the code
> to avoid naming conflicts
   Date - java.util
   Date - java.sql
> dao - data access object - responsible of interaction
> each package should contain classes interfaces which are related to each other

Wrapper Classes
> Wrapper classes in Java provide a mechanism to convert primitive data types into objects.
> for each primitive type java offers associated class known as wrapper class
> these classes are used to perform following conversions-
 1. Primitive to Wrapper
 2. Wrapper to Primitive
 3. Primitive to String
 4. String to Primitive
 5. Wrapper to String
 6. String to Wrapper
> all these wrapper classes are present in lang package
Primitve         Wrapper-Class
===============================
byte            Byte
short           Short
int             Integer
long            Long
float           Float
double          Double
char            Character
boolean         Boolean
> when we deal with collections in java, collections can only store objects
> if we see a horizontal line one a text in eclipse(IDE) it is deprecated
> deprecated means this API is old one and not recommended to use, maybe removed from newer versions

Auto-boxing/unboxing
> auto-boxing is a process of implicit conversion from primitive to wrapper type
> process of implicit conversion from wrapper to its primitive is known as auto-unboxing

Demon Thread
> Garbage collector is a demon thread
> Demon thread is service thread
> execution of garbage collector is completely under control of JVM
> When will GC execute and for how long it runs is completely controlled by JVM
> We cannot force JVM to run but we can request.
> It is for sure, when needed, GC will run.
> Reasons because of which object looses a references
 1. Reassigning reference to new object
 2. Assigning null value to reference
 3. Reference goes out of scope (e.g. when execution of a method gets over)

Finalize Method
> finalize method is automatically executed just before garbage collector collects the garbage object
> finalize method is present in Object super-class which we must appropriately override.
