Stream API
> it was introduced in JDK 8
> stream is used to process collection of data
> streams don't change existing collection 
> stream is present in java.util.stream package
> streams are evaluated lazily
> once a stream is used(consumed) cannot be reused again any attempts to do so generates an exception.
> Steps to use Stream
 1. create stream from source by invoking stream methods of the source. Source can be collection, array, stream
 2. invoke 1 or many intermediate operations based on business requirement 
 3. invoke a terminal operation and get the result

Intermediate Operation
> Any operations that returns stream is known as Intermediate Operation
> e.g. streamReference.filter(), streamReference.map() - Filter operation , map operations

Terminal Operation
> any operations that returns final result (other than stream) is known as Terminal Operation
> e.g. toList();

Reflection
> reflection is the process of inspecting, finding information about class, method, field
> this is typically done in following use cases 
 1. tool provider - e.g. Eclipse IDE 
 2. frameworks - e.g. Spring, Hibernate
 3. Annotation Processing
> there is a special class offered by Java known as Class which is in lang package which offers different methods to find information about a class. like fields, methods etc
> invoke getClass() method on object of any class whose information we want to find.
> reflection api is present is java.lang.package
> use reflection only when needed, unnecessary usage of reflection must be strictly avoided.

DAO (Data Access Object)
> it is a design pattern used to interact with data storage from java application
> data storage can be in memory, file system, database.
> We implement this pattern by writing java class responsible for CRUD operation
> for each entity we write separate DAO class
> naming convention for DAO class is -  EntityNameDaoImpl.java - e.g. StudentDaoImpl.java
> DAO class should be in its own package

Intermediate Operation - filter(), map()
Terminal Operation - toList(), findFirst(), forEach()


Rules for Java Files
> it can contain 0 or 1 package statement, if present, it must be the first statement
> after package statement we can have 0 or many import statements
> followed by class definition, interface definition , enum definition
> a java file can contain only 1 public class/interface/Enum
> but any number of non-public classes/interfaces/enums can be present
> comments can appear anywhere

Object Methods
clone() - 
> this is method of object super-class
> it allows us to create clone of existing object.
> the object that needs to be cloned must implements Cloneable interface
> Cloneable interface is from java.lang package
> Cloneable is a marker interface
> Cloneable helps you to create shallow copying
> deep copying must be explicitly done by developer of the class
