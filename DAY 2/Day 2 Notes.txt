Local Variables
> Variables which are declared inside a method or block are known as local variables e.g. Block means for loop, while loop, methods
> lifetime and scope of such variables is limited to the block or method in which they are declared
> any variable argument in a method is also a local variable e.g. main(String[] args)
> local Variables MUST be initialized before accessing

> When a problem statement is given to you as an Object oriented developer we must identify important business entities
> Entity is a real world thing that has well defined structure and behaviour 
> Represent those entities in java by defining classes and creating their objects
> Classes are blueprint/ template of a real world entity
> Objects are instance of that class

Instance Variables
> Variable declared a class but outside any method or block without static modifier is known as instance variable 
> Default value to instance variable is assigned, based on the datatype 

Cohesion
> it is degree to which a class has 1 single focused responsibility 
> ALL java classes must be Highly Cohesive Class
> Benefits of Highly Cohesive Classes are 
 1. Such Classes are reusable
 2. Maintainable - easy to maintain 


> In Java objects are created using new keyword
> Objects in java are always created on HEAP memory
> To access an object in HEAP we need to have a reference in STACK

This Reference
> this is a reference to current invoking object
> this reference is implicitly passed to each instance method of a class
	void display() {
		System.out.println(rollNumber); //this line is equivalent to this.rollNumber, compiler does that implicitly. It is recommended to use explicitly this reference inside instance method. It makes code readable
		System.out.println(this.name);
		System.out.println(this.marks);
	}


Access Specifiers
> java offers following 3 access specifiers but 4 access level controls
 1. public - accessible from anywhere 
 2. private - accessible only within the same class in which it is declared
 3. protected - accessible within same package to any class and outside the package only to sub-classes via inheritance
 4. Default(Access level control) - It is accessible only within same package


> each object has it's own copy of instance variables 


Constructors
> it is a special method automatically executed when object is created
> it has NO return type.
> it is used to initialized instance variables 
> it has same name as the class name
> constructors can be defined with any access specifier
> a constructor without any argument is known as NO argument constructor
> Constructor can accept parameters knowns parameterized constructor
> Keep number of arguments in parameterized constructor same as number of attributes.
> A class having no-argument constructor and parameterized constructor is known as constructor overloading
> Overloading is possible 
 1. If number of arguments are different
 2. and/or datatype of argument is different
 3. sequence of argument is different


Method Overloading
> if we defined more than 1 method in same class with same name but different signature it is known as method overloading
> method signature consist of number of argurment. datatypes of arguments, sequence of arguments


====Static 
Variable
> A variable declared inside class but outside any method or block with static modifier is known as static variable.
> Only 1 copy of static variable is created irrespective of number of objects of a class.
> We can apply any access modifier to static variable 
> static variable is assigned default value based on the datatype 

Methods
> methods can also be marked using static modifier
> static variables , methods are independent of object hence it can be directly accessed using class name
> e.g. System.out.println(); --- System is a class which is directly letting us access member 'out' which is static so that we don't have to create an object
> public static void main(String[] args) --- main is static so that JVM can call main without having to create any object


> In java you can declare multiple variables with same name provided their scopes are different
