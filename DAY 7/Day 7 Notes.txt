* Character Hierarchy:

Reader ----> File Reader



Writer ----> File Writer

&nbsp;      ----> Print Writer



* Byte Hierarchy:

1. This hierarchy  is used for byte binary files. such as images,audio,videos.





All the classes from IO package are good to use if we do not work with multiple threads as all methods are blocking call.

We cannot perform high intensive read/write operations.

To over come this drawback Java introduced set of new classes in completely new package known as java.nio.

nio -> Non Blocking IO





Collection Framework:-

* It allows you to hold collection of data.
* Drawbacks of arrays:

&nbsp;	- Size of the array , it cannot grow or shrink dynamically.

&nbsp;	- To insert new element, to remove existing element from array is very difficult \& time-consuming.

&nbsp;	- Arrays can hold similar types of elements.



Collections:-

* Java offers implementation of data structure using collection frameworks.
* collection -> Java's implementation of Data Structure.
* All the classes \& interfaces are present in java.util package.



Generics:-

* It was introduced in JDK 5
* It is strongly recommended to use collection classes with generics to make collection type safe.
* Collection without generic is known as Raw Type.
* Though it is allowed it is not recommended to use.





Collections is a class 



Collection without generics can create runtime issues. We must avoid it by trying to resolve these errors during compile time to do so we use generics.





* Iterate using advanced for loop
* Only for readonly operation from beginning to end sequentially
* We cannot modify collection
* If we want to iterate over collection object if you want to remove a specific element from the collection we should use Iterator object



Iterator:-

* Its an interface present in java.util package
* This interface is implemented by respective collection class
* Steps:-

&nbsp;	- Obtain the Iterator Object by invoking iterator method.

&nbsp;	- Write a loop to check if collection object has next element present in it by invoking hasNext 	  method of Iterator object.

&nbsp;	- Get the next Element from collection by invoking next method of iterator object.

&nbsp;	- Optionally we can remove a specific element from collection object by invoking remove method of 	  iterator object



Comparable Interface:-

* It is an interface
* It is from java.lang package.
* It has one abstract method in it public int compareto(args-1)
* This interface is use to define natural sorting algorithm for a class



Comparator:-

* Using comparable we can provide only one sorting algorithm for any specific class.
* But in real world you might want to sort object of a specific class on multiple different criteria.
* Todo so Java offers built in interface known as Comparator.



Java.util.Date Class:-
