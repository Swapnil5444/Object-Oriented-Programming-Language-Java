                                                                          DAY 1 NOTES
> Java is a case sensitive language
> Java is a statically typed language means compiler must know what type is gonna be used for the variable

Identifier - user defined name given to variable, class, methods, constants etc

> Java (or any programming language) is a combination of keywords and identifiers

Rules for Identifiers
1. a keyword cannot be identifier
2. Identifier name cannot contain space, special characters
3. identifier cannot start with a digit
4. identifier can be combination of alphabets, digits, underscore(_), $
5. identifier can be of any length

Naming Conventions
1. Class - 
1st letter of the class name should be in upper case.
if class consist of more than 1 word then 1st letter of each word should be in uppercase.
   eg.HelloWorld
Java class name should be a noun.

2. variable - 
variable name should be small and meaningful. 
1st letter of 1st word should be in small case. 
If variable consist of multiple words except 1st word, 1st letter of each word should be in upper case

3. Methods - 
method name should start with a verb e.g. display(), calculate(), accept(), print(). 
Method name can also consist of verb followed by a noun e.g calculateSalary(), getName(), setId(). 
1st letter of 1st word should be in small case.
If method consist of multiple words except 1st word, 1st letter of each word should be in upper case



>JRE uses JVM to RUN the java code the .class file

>If you make source code change you must re-compile the source code

>client machine only needs JRE on their machine to run the java code

> .class file is only created only if there are no syntactical errors in the source code

> System and String are both built-in classes offered by java


> Variable is a named container in memory which can store a value and the value can be change(vary)
> to declare a variable in java use following syntax
data_type name_of_variable;
java offers following 8 primitive data types , they are as follows

(store whole numbers - e.g. RollNo)
1. byte 
2. short
3. int
4. long

(store decimal values - e.g. Marks)
5. float
6. double

(store any single character in single quotes - e.g. 'S')
7. char

(stores true or false)
8. Boolean

Type Casting
long l = 24;
int i = 12;
i = (int)l; //Narrowing
l = i       //widening (implicitly occurs)

Methods
> In java a method cannot be defined directly inside another method

> method is execute only if it is invoked(called) 

NOTE:- while writing classes follow
1. Follow naming convention
2. Indentation
3. Comments if needed

> java supports 3 types of comments 
	1. single line comments - //
	2. multi line comments - /* */
	3. documentation comments - /** */



Operators
> operators are one which performs operation on operands
1. Assignment Operators - used to assign a value to a variable e.g. a = 20
2. Relational(comparison) Operators - e.g. < > <= >= != == - these always going to result into boolean values
3. Arithmetic operators - [+, -, /, *, %]
4. Logical operators - && (both conditions should be true), ||(atleast 1 conditions should be true), !(negates the condition)

NOTE:- In java for any conditional expression value must result to Boolean types, if not, compilation error occurs

Conditional Constructs
> if we have just 1 statement in if block, else if block, else block, writing curly braces for these blocks is optional
> switch cases are available since JDK 1.
> it is not mandatory to write break after each case but execution of cases will happen till the time 1st break is encountered, this process is known as fall through and execution
>Use case of switch case is menu driven application


IDE(Integrated Development Environment) offers following features
1. Indentation
2. Auto-completion of code
3. curly brace matching
4. Colour highlighting
5. The moment you save the source code, auto compilation happens

these feature helps developer to write code quickly with less effort and time hence while working on real projects you'd prefer using IDEs.
In java community following are few popular IDE's
> eclipse
> STS
> intellij
> netbeans

LOOPS
1. for loops - 
>if there is only 1 statement in the loop then curly braces are optional
> it is called Entry Control loop
> minimum number of iterations in iterations is 0
> for is used when we know number of iterations in advanced

2. while loops - 
>if there is only 1 statement in the loop then curly braces are optional
> it is called Entry Control loop
> minimum number of iterations in iterations is 0
> while is used when we DON'T know number of iterations in advanced

2. do while - 
> it is called Exit Control loop
> minimum number of iterations in iterations is 1
> Do while is used to perform at least 1 iteration without checking condition
